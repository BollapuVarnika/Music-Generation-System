Music Generation Using RNN


      Music composition is a complex and creative process that requires knowledge of melody, harmony, and rhythm. Traditional music creation can be time-consuming and demands expertise, 
    making it challenging for beginners or those without formal training. With advancements in artificial intelligence, there is a growing interest in automating music generation using    
    machine learning techniques.
	
     Our project, Music Generation System Using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), aims to develop an AI-based model capable of composing melodies by learning patterns from existing music 
 datasets. We utilize RNN, to analyse and predict musical sequences. The model isn trained on MIDI files, allowing it to understand note transitions, rhythm, and harmony.One of the main 
 challenges in AI-generated music is maintaining musical coherence and creativity, as many models tend to produce repetitive or unnatural sequences. Our approach addresses this by 
 implementing optimized training techniques and diverse datasets, ensuring that the generated music is both harmonically rich and structurally sound.

     The system takes a seed sequence of notes as input and generates new musical compositions by predicting the next notes iteratively. The output is then converted into a MIDI file, which 
   can be played, modified, or integrated into various applications. This music generation system has significant applications in music production, content creation, game and film scoring 
   and AI-assisted composition. By leveraging deep learning techniques, our project aims to explore AIâ€™s potential in the creative field, providing a tool for automated and interactive 
   music generation. In the future, we aim to enhance the system by integrating genre-specific music generation, real-time improvisation, and user-controlled customization, allowing 
   composers to guide the AI in generating music tailored to their needs. Through this project, we explore the intersection of AI and creative arts, demonstrating how technology can assist 
   and enhance human artistic expression.
